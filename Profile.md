## About Me:

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything web-development related!
- 📫 How to reach me: HandsomeBlizzard@proton.me

## My History in Computers:

- 🌐 I know how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for the most part). I also, learned JSON and used the four to create a static website about Canada: [ExploreCanadianProvinces](canadianprovinces.web.app/). The website isn't complete yet, but you can message me feedback or advice to improve the website, especially the front-end.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm looking for ideas to make a basic program in Java to prove my competency in the language.
- 🙋🏼‍♂️ I'm going to make another static website using React.js and TypeScript. The website will higlight all my technical skills and showcase all my projects for prospective employers and partners to look at.
